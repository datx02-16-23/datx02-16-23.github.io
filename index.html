      <h3>Progress (updated weekly)</h3>
      <ul>
	<li>
	  <h4>Visual prototyping <span class=week>Week 4</span></h4>
	  <p>
	    This week, we've finished the planning report but the more
	    interesting thing is that we started creating visual prototypes
	    of what we believe we want to do. The intermittent language of the
	    final product will be created as a analysis of the visual
	    prototypes and how a language could describe them.
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h4>Planning, planning, planning <span class=week>Week 3</span></h4>
	  <p>
	    This weeks focus has been on creating a good planning report. We
	    have done some meetings and a workshop leading up to a somewhat
	    finished planning report, what's left is some spellchecking and
	    creating LaTeX files.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    We have started setting up Scrum model, where we are using
	    Waffle.io as technical support and Dennis is our Scrum Master. We
	    are going to have an initial backlog workshop when the planning
	    report is done. 
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h4>"Dream on while you can" <span class=week>Week 2</span></h4>
	  <p>This week we thought we were somewhat done with our vison. In no
	    substantial way was this true. After our supervisor meeting, he
	    gave us some well needed insights that it's better to do a cool
	    thing, breaking new ground, than just to focus on what is
	    deliverable as soon and easy as possible.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Our vision has changed, now we are targeting in making a good
	    intermediate representation of a visualization, instead of hooking
	    some Java annotations to a drawing function. This intermediate
	    representation will represent a "steppable" visualization, instead
	    of being directly hooked to a programming language environment.
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h4>A bit on how we work<span class=week>Week 1</span></h4>
	  <p>As this first week is over we have set up aids and systems on
	    how to collaborate. We've agreed on trying to have two standard
	    meetings each weeks, usually one at the start and one in the end
	    of each week. Time reports are done through a
	    <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j_dDEQvt_7GSotPnRed0rqV_XxK8JbJ0Vp3P-1jW6vM/edit">
	      collaborative spreadsheet
	    </a>. We will use ShareLaTeX for joint work on the final report and
	    GitHub for working on code.	    
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    As for roles in the project we have a project leader, Ivar, and
	    an evaluator, Jonathan. The project leader role is responsible for
	    driving the project forward and the evaluator is responsible
	    making sure what's done is done and of good standard. The roles
	    may rotate between project members throughout the project.
	  </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <h4>First (official) week of the project!
	    <span class=week>Week 1</span>
	  </h4>
	  
	  <p>Inbetween our first lectures we've had two meetings. In our tuesday
	    meeting we agreed on methods of communications, ways to share
	    resources and meeting templates. We started working on our vision and
	    made a draft of our group contract.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In our second meeting, we started doing status reports, a recurring
	    point on each meeting onward. We also, by some of the insights of
	    lectures this week, decided to assign roles. Ivar is assigned
	    project leader until further notice and Jonathan is assigned to
	    evaluate the project process through this part of the project.	  
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    We have limited the scope of the project a bit by deciding on some
	    restrictions. The focus of our project should be tracking changes
	    to data structures and enforcing a 2D visualisation of simpler
	    data structures, annotated by a custom markup. The target of our
	    project will be Java and simpler data structures, but should be
	    easy to extend to other languages and data structures in the future.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Our priority for the next week is finishing a draft for the
	    project planning report.
	  </p>
	</li>

	<li>
	  <h4>A startup meeting
	    <span class=week>Week 0</span>
	  </h4>
	  <p>
	    At 2015-12-17 we had our first meeting. The meeting focused on
	    deliverables, methods of communication and some brief pointers on
	    project management. Also, we got some needed pointers of what our
	    project proposal lacks. The project proposal is unclear and our
	    bibliograpy is severely lacking. We got tasked to produce a web site
	    containing contact information, project diary and minutes.
